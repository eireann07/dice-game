# Dice Game
*Basic dice game written in vanilla JavaScript deployed [here](https://eireann07.github.io/dice-game/) with Github pages. On refresh, the dice "re-roll" to create a new outcome.*

**What I enjoyed while building this site:** FINALLY MAKING IT WORK. It was so exciting when I was able to make all of the different aspects come together and actually do what they needed to do was exhilarating. 

**What I struggled with while building this site:** Getting the heading to change to reflect the dice change. It took a lot longer than I thought it would to create the conditionals to make sure that the heading changes when there's an outcome from the game. 

**Things I learned through building this site:** So. Much. JavaScript. Dot notation is actually really cool, and I can't wait for some of the JS methods to become more ingrained...but knowing the documentation exists to help me figure out whatever I need is really reassuring.
